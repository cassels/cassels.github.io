There has been a growing debate over the last decade or so regarding the purpose of short films in today's over saturated market. 

In one camp you have filmmakers who argue [against short filmmaking][1] because nobody hires a short filmmaker anymore.

And in the other camp, you have those who argue in favour of short filmmaking as a medium to hone your skills.

The reality lies somewhere in between and I think both camps are missing the point by focusing too much on the career impact of shorts. 

While it is important to never loose sight of your career goals and aspirations, I fear that too many filmmakers have lost sight of why they chose to be a filmmaker in the first place.

>I make films because I love telling stories. <a class="social social-tweetable" data-quote="I make films because I love telling stories. " data-href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet" data-hashtags="filmmaking, storytelling, screenwriting">Tweet This!</a>

I make films because I love telling stories. I always have and I always will. Of course I have aspirations and goals but I will never loose sight of why I make films.

I love quirky stories, action stories, romance stories, adventure stories, you name it. I can genuinely get behind any film, book or performance, regardless of length, as long as the underlying story is captivating and ignites my imagination.

Short films provide an excellent outlet for my imagination because sometimes an idea isn't best served as a feature or a tv/web series, it's best served as a short, and I embrace that. 

It may not be an award winning short or an internet sensation, but it's fun, enjoyable, and liberating - once an idea becomes a short film it can free my brain to be creative elsewhere.

So go forth, and make shorts!

Happy Filmmaking!
