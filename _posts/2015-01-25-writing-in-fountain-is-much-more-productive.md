##Switching to Fountain 

I've spent years faffing around with chunky, bulky, heavy-weight screenwriting apps like Final Draft, Fade In, Celtx and many others, only to quit in frustration and move on because they're all exactly the same - which is chunky, bulky, heavy-weight screenwriting apps from the mid-90s. 

I'm not a hollywood professional, I don't write spec scripts, I don't even write feature lengths that often, and I certainly don't get too many chances to sit at my desk and write for hours at a time. 

I write whenever and wherever I can squeeze in a quick half an hour. So for me, productivity and portability are the most crucial aspects of a screenwriting app.

Technically, [Fountain][1] is not a screenwriting app, its a markup language. If your technically minded then think of it as a screenwriter's version of John Gruber's [markdown][2]. If your not technically minded then it's magic, pure magic.

##Portability

Fountain is just plain text, so it can be written in any text editor on any platform, even mobile and cloud platforms like Google Docs. I can collaborate with anyone from anywhere because it's readable by everyone and everything. At my desk, on the train, walking to work, I can write a screenplay wherever I want.

##Productivity

Fountain was designed by a handful of writers, including [John August][3], and it's free to use. Furthermore, all the behind the scenes magic that takes place is open source. This means there's an ever growing [repository][4] of beautiful applications using it already. 

I freely jumped from application to application before finally choosing [Slugline][5] as my new screenwriting app of choice. I've been using Slugline for two weeks now and I absolutely love it. I chose it because of its distraction free writing interface - it only has *one* button - which is perfect for my writing process.

Thanks to [Slugline][5] and [Fountain][1], I am no longer distracted by popup notifications, I am no longer fighting against mid-90s interfaces, and my half-hour 'here and there' writing sessions have increased in productivity. 

Happy Writing!
