Filmmaking is hard! There's no doubt about it. Like all artistic forms, a film can be loved, loathed, or a bit of both, but it's always taken for granted.

Anyone that's been involved in a film (even a short) understands how difficult and time consuming it can be to bring your imagination to screen.

Weeks of hard work and preparation in the pre-production stage can only help to soften the blow of the inevitable slip-up or unlucky weather that dooms your shoot.

After wrap, the cast and crew are elated but as the producer/director, you know you're not clear of the storm yet. 

Hours after hours, you'll spend syncing video with audio. Day after day you'll spend tinkering with your edit. Week after week you'll spend fighting procrastination, and month after month you'll spend promoting your film.

And once it's all over... you'll do it again. You're an addict!

###It's your passion!

The word [PASSION][1] originates from the word PATI which means SUFFER in Latin.  

Sometimes filmmaking can be hard, painful and expensive. Sometimes you can loose the inspiration that made you tick. Sometimes you can fall victim to some foul-mouthed critics, but hopefully you can take comfort in knowing that your suffering will be worth it.

No pain, no gain as they say.

Happy Filmmaking!
