Unfortunately, a successful career in filmmaking doesn't come with a roadmap. 

And because of this, we often find ourselves scouring the depths of the internet seeking advice. 

Well, I've just recently had an epiphany about filmmaking as a career which I'm happy to share with you all...

It's just a huge game of Snakes & Ladders!

Snakes and Ladders (also known as Chutes and Ladders) is a board game that's etched into the memories of anyone over 20. The idea is simple. Roll the dice to move your 'player'. If you land on a square at the bottom of a ladder, you climb the ladder to another square. If the square you land on is at the mouth of a snake, you slide down the snake's body to the square at the tail. First one to the last square wins. Simples!

So let's assume that each square is a step in your filmmaking career. Each ladder is then: a new professional connection; an award; a good review; or a "break through" moment. And each snake is: rejection, a bad review, a comercial/critical flop, or a complete meltdown. 

Now when you look up to filmmakers, actors, writers, editors, or whoever you aspire to, and wonder how they achieved so much, take comfort in the fact that they are playing the same game as you.

So let's assume the last square is the stuff of legends. It's significantly more ambitious than your most ambitious career goal. You're not meant to achieve this level of success but by aiming for it, you could soar higher than you'll ever imagine.

The first square is your decision to be a filmmaker, and so from that point onwards it's as easy as rolling the dice and taking the next step. Maybe that next step is a ladder, fantastic. Maybe it's a snake, not-so-fantastic. But most importantly, keep rolling the dice and keep taking the next step. 

Just as it's possible to finish a game of Snakes and Ladders without ever landing on a ladder, it's also possible to achieve success without ever achieving a "break through".

Aim for the ladders and avoid as many snakes as you can, but always, always, always roll the dice and continue forwards. 

Happy Filmmaking!
