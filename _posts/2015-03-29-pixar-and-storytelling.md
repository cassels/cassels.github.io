    alt: 01. You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-02.jpg
    alt: 02. You gotta keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer. They can be v. different.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-03.jpg
    alt: 03. Trying for theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is actually about til you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-04.jpg
    alt: 04. Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-05.jpg
    alt: 05. Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-06.jpg
    alt: 06. What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-07.jpg
    alt: 07. Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-08.jpg
    alt: 08. Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-09.jpg
    alt: 09. When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-10.jpg
    alt: 10. Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-11.jpg
    alt: 11. Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-12.jpg
    alt: 12. Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th – get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-13.jpg
    alt: 13. Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-14.jpg
    alt: 14. Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-15.jpg
    alt: 15. If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-16.jpg
    alt: 16. What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-17.jpg
    alt: 17. No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on – it’ll come back around to be useful later.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-18.jpg
    alt: "18. You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining."
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-19.jpg
    alt: 19. Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-20.jpg
    alt: "20. Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d’you rearrange them into what you DO like?"
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-21.jpg
    alt: 21. You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?
  - src: /imgs/posts/images/pixar-rules-22.jpg
    alt: 22. What’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.

At the young age of four years old, [Pixar][pixar]'s [Toy Story][toy1] was released in the cinemas and was one of, if not *the*, defining film of my childhood and future career(s). 

Like many children, Toy story struck a chord in me. Each film that [Pixar][pixar] subsequently released ([A Bug's Life][bugs], [Toy Story 2][toy2], [Monsters Inc][monsters]) fuelled my imagination until I found myself desperately trying to emulate the magic. 

By the time [Finding Nemo][nemo] came out, twelve year old me was making all kinds of animations. My mother loved them, as mum's do, but believe me when I say they were shockingly bad. 

My interest in the magic of Pixar eventually led to an interest in computers, and computer graphics in particular. 

For the next six years I learned all there was to know about [Steve Jobs][jobs], [Ed Catmull][catmull] and the team behind the technology at Pixar, building on my knowledge in preparation for my Computer Science degree at the University of Strathclyde. At eighteen, I moved out of the family home and started my degree still very much in love with modern Pixar films ([Wall-e][walle], [Up][up]).

Throughout Pixar's life, they've hardly put a foot out of place. With the possible exception of [Cars][cars1] and [Cars 2][cars2], every single Pixar film is a gem of pure joy and I'll rush to the cinema, filled with glee, for every new film released. Why so? Because they know the art of storytelling. 

In 2011, a former story artist at Pixar, [Emma Coats][emma], tweeted a series of tips from her time at Pixar. Imgur artist, [DinoIgnacio][dino], superimposed these tips onto stills of their films. 

I know I'm really late to the game here but I wish to post these for anyone who hasn't seen them already and as a reminder to myself when I'm writing my own stories. If only I had these when I was 12.

Happy Writing!
