<p>Robin Williams was one of the greatest performers to have ever graced our screens. He was a master of his craft and a gift to this world.</p>

<p>He demonstrated his brilliance time and time again with each and every character he portrayed leaving us all with many memorable moments.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tonyszhou">Tony Zhou</a>, as part of his <a href ="https://facebook.com/everyframeapainting">Every Frame a Painting</a> series, has paid tribute to Robin in the video below. He looks at some of Robin's best performances and shows us what we can learn from Robin as filmmakers.</p>

<h2>What we can learn from Robin Williams?</h2>
<h3>1. Free your Actors</h3>
<p>Robin Williams worked with some of the world's best directors in his career, and as Tony points out in the video above, they each had one thing in common - their actors were given an uninterrupted freedom to act.</p>
<p>If you have genuine talent in front of your camera, let them shine. They are the face of your story and their performance can make or break your film, so give them the opportunity.</p>

<blockquote>Allow your actors the freedom to act. Straight through, uninterrupted.<a class="social social-tweetable" data-quote="Allow your actors the freedom to act.

<h3>2. Physical Interaction</h3>
<p>Encourage your actors to interact with the set. Very rarely do we sit or stand still in life, we're always touching things, fiddling things, and breaking things. So encourage your actors to interact with the set and discuss what each interaction means to their character.</p>

<h3>3. Show, don't Tell</h3>
<p>Each Robin Williams scene can be played on mute and you'll still know exactly what's going on. Humans are universally hard-wired to pick up on body language and subtle gestures. Before you shoot your next scene, block it with your actors and figure out how best to show it visually.</p>

<h3>3. Watch them Listening</h3>
<p>Acting is reacting. Just because your actor isn't speaking doesn't mean they're not acting. A reaction shot can be a powerful tool in a filmmaker's toolbox. Watch your actors listening to others, watch them watch TV, watch them hear a knock at the door, just watch them do everything and you'll find what you need when editing later.</p>

<h3>4. Inspiration</h3>
<p>Filmmaking is a collaborative process, so encourage inspiration from your entire cast and crew. You are never better than your cast and crew combined so don't stifle their performances by shutting down each spark they have. Let them run with it and see what happens. In the worst case scenario it doesn't work out and you reshoot the scene.</p>

<p class="post-signature">Happy Filmmaking!</p>
