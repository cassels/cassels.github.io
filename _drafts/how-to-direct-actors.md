####When an actor wins an Academy Award, they take to the stage and profusely thank the director for "getting the performance out of me". Other than their significant others, the actor will thank the director more than anyone else they've ever known. 

Of course, they may be sucking through a straw to ensure they're hired again, or ensuring that their public image remains in tact as a humbling, thankful and selfless actor. 

However, nine times out of ten when the camera cuts from the bumbling actor to the director in question, he or she will be sitting, hands clasped, eyes locked on the stage, smiling with an overwhelming sense of pride for his or her colleague, and at that moment you can tell it's a genuine "Thank-you".

There's no metric for measuring an actors performance but it's a lot easier to spot than to teach. When watching a strong performance the scene will completely engulfed you. A bad performance will make you cringe until you can't bear anymore but a good performance will have you hanging on every word and emotion until the very last breath.

It's important to understand that directing a great performance begins well before the cameras start rolling. An actor may deliver a great performance on set but the director's role begins well in advance.

###Cast the Correct Actor

Notice how I've used "correct" and not "best". The correct actor may not be the most talented or the most established but the absolute best for the role. Of course, the actor must be able to act, but when it comes to picking an actor from a hand full of suitable candidates then look at the actor as a person.

He or she should be passionate about something. Passionate people can be easily directed because passionate people have a compulsory drive to learn and improve.

An actor should not rest on his or her laurels, and instead should approach each role wide-eyed and eager to improve - nobody is perfect when casting.

An actor should have a personality. Ask them non-role and non-film related questions during the audition, get an idea for who they are - you're going to be spending a lot of time with this person so ensure you like them. Bear in mind, they may have default answers to default questions, try catching them off guard.

If you narrow it down to just a few actors, try inviting each individual out for a coffee or a drink. Spend an hour with each of them and don't speak about the role until the very end, if at all. Let them do most of the talking while you try to understand what makes them tick.

A director is just a glorified team leader, so invest the time building the strongest team you can. A cast and crew that gets along off set is a cast and crew that gets along on set. If you cast actors as part of a team, they will feed off each other's positivity and perform better than you can ever imagine - with very little effort on your part.

###Explore the character with them

After the correct cast has been selected, you need to nurture them towards a performance of a life time. Remember, you are the director and your job is to direct them, not dictate them. Too often, directors asume they are the be all and end all and that nobody knows better than them. Unless your Alfred Hitchcock, which your not, then you don't know what's best all the time. You need to let go of your actors and let them flourish, let them take ownership of their characters, and find their own voice. Give them the creative freedom they deserve and you will reep the rewards.

Encourage them to explore their character, sit with them and help them achieve this. But remember, _you_ are not exploring the character, _they_ are. They are the driving force behind the exploration and you are their navigator. You might already know where they'll end up but you must let them discover their own way there because the exploration is the most important part when building a solid character.

What they discover is never wrong, so don't tell them it is - their ideas may differ from yours but that doesn't make them wrong. If you don't like what their discovering then change the direction. 

Never say "No, that's not right!", instead say "That's interesting, but what about...?". It's a subtle difference but an important one because it can benefit you greatly as a director further down the production line. The actor will take complete ownership of the character resulting in a heightened performance, all because it originated from within them, and not assigned to them.

###Befriend your Actors

I can not stress this enough! In general, befriend everyone you work with because it's a people industry. I'd also like to reiterate that a director is just a glorified team leader and I'm sure we've all had experiences with a team leader that's a bit of a self righteous tool - don't be 'that guy'. Engage with your actors on and off production, be there for your actors like you would for your best friends. Be the shoulder to cry on and the smile to laugh with.

Acting is very difficult, so respect your actors and make it as easy as possible for them to do their job. Making an actor feel comfortable on set goes a long way towards a great performance. You can make them feel comfortable by befriending them, by showing them you care, and by building trust long before the shoot begins. If they believe they are in good hands they will act freely with one hundred percent of their efforts devoted to their performance. The other ten percent (yes, to make 110% effort) will come from their desire to work, impress, and improve. If they like, trust, and respect you, they will go the extra mile.

###Last but not Least

Don't push an actor too hard. A strong performance is a natural performance, not a forced one. Don't rehearse to much, don't do take after take after take and always give them positive feedback. Always.
