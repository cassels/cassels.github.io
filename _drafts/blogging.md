The film industry, like any other industry, is often about who you know and not what you know. Of course, if you're technically incompetent or completely lack creativity then you're limiting your chances of success somewhat, but even if you're the next Leonardo DaVinci, you will never make that all important first step unless you're incredibly lucky or you know someone who knows someone... or more accurately, that someone knows you.

Festivals and other networking events are second to none for meeting industry professionals, producers, future colleagues, and at the very least, some of the most interesting people in the world. 

Many successful filmmakers have met key collaborators through these events, and many more will continue to do so in the future, but in the modern world where anyone from anywhere can make a film and become a filmmaker how can we stand head and shoulders above the rest in such a saturated market. 

The answer is to build a personal brand identity, which in its entirety, is beyond the scope of this post.

Maintaining a blog is a large part of building a strong online brand, if you don't believe me look at all the largest brands in the world - examples of brand blogs

A well written and well thought out blog post acts like a magnetic force by pulling potential clients, producers, writers or other filmmakers to your content via Google, Twitter and other social media. Interaction with your brand via a post can happen 24/7 at any point.

A successful blog can make a successful online brand, a successful online brand does not make a successful filmmaker but it sure as hell doesn't hurt. 

You still might not know anyone in the industry to call upon yet but the possibility that they know you has increased which means your one step closer to living the life you want to live. 

I'll be sure to update this post if anyone from hollywood comes knocking. 

Happy Blogging
